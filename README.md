Overview of the LED Blinking Project
Objective
The LED Blinking project is a fundamental exercise in embedded systems programming. It demonstrates how to control hardware (an LED) using software (code written in C). This project helps beginners understand the basics of microcontroller programming, GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) operations, and the relationship between hardware and software in embedded systems.

Key Concepts
Microcontroller Basics:

The microcontroller (e.g., ATmega328P in Arduino Uno) acts as the "brain" that processes instructions and controls the hardware (LED in this case).
It has GPIO pins that can be configured as input or output.
Hardware Interfacing:

The LED is an output device connected to a GPIO pin.
Proper interfacing with a resistor prevents overcurrent and ensures safe operation.
Timing and Control:

The code controls the LED by toggling its state (on/off) at regular intervals.
Timing is implemented using delays (_delay_ms() function in C).
Hardware Components
Arduino Uno:

A microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P.
Provides GPIO pins, power supply, and programming interface.
LED:

A Light Emitting Diode that emits light when powered.
Resistor (220Î©):

Limits the current flowing through the LED to prevent damage.
Additional Tools:

Breadboard, jumper wires, and a USB cable for programming and power.
Software Components
Programming Language:

Code is written in C for low-level hardware control.
Development Environment:

AVR-GCC: Compiler for the C program.
AVRDUDE: Tool for uploading compiled code to the microcontroller.
Alternatively, the Arduino IDE can be used for simplified programming.
Core Functions:

_delay_ms() (from <util/delay.h>): Creates delays for LED blinking.
Register Operations: Direct manipulation of microcontroller registers (DDRB, PORTB) for GPIO control.
Working Principle
The microcontroller pin connected to the LED is configured as an output.
The program turns the LED on by setting the GPIO pin HIGH.
After a delay, the program turns the LED off by setting the GPIO pin LOW.
This cycle repeats continuously, making the LED blink at a specific interval.
Applications
Learning Tool:

Introduces fundamental programming concepts like loops, delays, and bit manipulation.
Provides hands-on experience with hardware control.
Foundation for Advanced Projects:
Serves as a base for more complex projects like traffic lights, digital counters, or user-interface devices.
