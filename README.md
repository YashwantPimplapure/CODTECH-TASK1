Project Overview: Real-Time Sensor Data Logging with an STM32 Microcontroller
This project involves programming an STM32 microcontroller to log sensor data in real time. The logged data can either be stored on an SD card or transmitted wirelessly via a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module. The project is ideal for applications such as IoT devices, environmental monitoring, or industrial data logging.

Key Components:
STM32 Microcontroller

The core of the system, responsible for data acquisition, processing, and communication.
Example: STM32F4, STM32F1, or STM32H7 series depending on processing requirements.
Sensors

Could include temperature, humidity, pressure, accelerometer, or other sensors.
Example: DHT22 (temperature and humidity) or MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope).
Data Storage (SD Card)

For local storage of logged data.
Example: SD card module using SPI interface.
Wireless Communication Module

For remote transmission of data.
Wi-Fi Example: ESP8266 or ESP32 module.
Bluetooth Example: HC-05 or BLE module (e.g., nRF52).
Power Supply

Power the system with a stable supply, either battery or USB-based.
Workflow:
Sensor Data Acquisition

Use STM32 ADC, I2C, or SPI interfaces to collect data from sensors.
Implement data processing or filtering if needed.
Data Logging

Option 1: Store the data locally on an SD card using the SPI protocol.
Option 2: Send the data wirelessly via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth using UART or SPI.
Real-Time Operation

Implement interrupt-driven or DMA-based methods for efficient, real-time data collection.
Utilize an RTOS (e.g., FreeRTOS) for task scheduling if multiple operations (e.g., data acquisition and communication) need to run concurrently.
Debugging and Monitoring

Use serial debugging (UART) to validate data during development.
Optional: Implement live data streaming to a PC for monitoring during testing.
Development Tools:
Hardware

STM32 Nucleo or Discovery board.
USB-to-UART adapter (for debugging).
SD card module and wireless communication module.
Software

STM32CubeIDE for development and debugging.
STM32 HAL/LL drivers or CMSIS for peripheral management.
FreeRTOS (optional) for task management.
